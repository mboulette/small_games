Thank you for downloading City at Night Backgrounds! I hope you enjoy using this file.

Includes a selection of JPGs with different colors and styles, and a PSD file for easy editing. 

• To change the color just turn on or off the color blending layers. 
• To use your own colors, just create a layer and change the blending to "color" - the same as the existing color layers. 
• Change the colors of the northern lights in the sky - edit the hue/saturation layers.
• Use the overlay blending layer in the Merged Versions folder to create cool higher contrast verions!

I have applied surface blur (in Photoshop) to the "clean" jpgs included, this gives the images a smoother and cleaner look.
If you want to apply surface blur to jpegs you have exported - just click 

Filter > Blur > surface Blur

Settings - 

Radius: 5 Threshold: 4
